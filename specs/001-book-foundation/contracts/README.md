# API Contracts: Phase 1 – Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Foundation

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Foundation is a static content site built with Docusaurus. As such, there are no API contracts required for this phase.

## Explanation

This phase focuses entirely on creating static content for the book, including:
- Module structures
- Chapter content
- Hero sections with images
- Footer content
- Static styling and layout

Since there is no server-side processing, user data persistence, or dynamic content generation in Phase 1, no APIs are required.

## Future Phases

API contracts will be introduced in future phases:
- Phase 2: AI Chatbot (RAG system) will require APIs for chat functionality and vector storage
- Phase 3: Authentication will require APIs for user management
- Phase 4: Personalization will require APIs for user preferences and content adaptation
- Phase 5: Translation will require APIs for language processing

## Compliance with Constitution

This approach maintains strict adherence to the project constitution by:
- Implementing only Phase 1 features
- Not including any backend or dynamic features
- Preserving phase isolation
- Ensuring no scope creep from future phases
