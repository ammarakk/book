# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. This interactive book teaches students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots using modern robotics middleware, physics simulation, embodied AI, and vision-language-action systems.

## Overview

This book is structured into 5 modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore simulation environments for robotics
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Understand AI integration in robotics
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Discover multimodal AI systems for robotics
5. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Integrate all concepts into a complete system

## Development Phases

This project follows a phased development approach:

- **Phase 1**: Book Foundation (Content & Structure) - Complete
- **Phase 2**: AI Chatbot (RAG System) - Planned
- **Phase 3**: Authentication & User Profiles - Planned
- **Phase 4**: Personalization Engine - Planned
- **Phase 5**: Translation System - Planned
