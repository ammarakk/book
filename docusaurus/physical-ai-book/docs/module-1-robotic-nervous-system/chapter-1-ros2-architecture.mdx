# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture

This chapter introduces the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for many robotic applications.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- The core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- How nodes, topics, services, and actions work together
- The differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System. It addresses many of the limitations of ROS 1, particularly in the areas of:

- **Real-time support**: Better support for real-time systems
- **Deterministic behavior**: More predictable timing and execution
- **Multi-robot systems**: Better support for multiple robots
- **Commercial product support**: Designed with industry needs in mind

## Core Concepts

The core concepts in ROS 2 include:

### Nodes

A node is a process that performs computation. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 program.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1
```

### Topics and Messages

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Messages are the data packets sent from publishers to subscribers.

### Services

Services provide a request/reply interaction pattern between nodes.

## ROS 2 vs ROS 1

| Feature | ROS 1 | ROS 2 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Middleware | Custom | DDS |
| Real-time | Limited | Improved |
| Multi-robot | Challenging | Better |
| Security | None | Built-in |

## Practical Example

Let's create a simple publisher and subscriber:

```python
# publisher.py
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Summary

ROS 2 provides a robust framework for developing robotic applications. Its architecture is designed to be more reliable, secure, and suitable for commercial applications than its predecessor.
