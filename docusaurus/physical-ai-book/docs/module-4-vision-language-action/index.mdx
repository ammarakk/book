# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the fourth module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers multimodal AI systems that integrate vision, language, and action for robotics applications.

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore:
- Multimodal AI systems
- Computer vision in robotics
- Natural language processing for robots
- Action execution systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How vision-language-action systems enable complex robot behaviors
- The integration of perception and action in robotics
- How to implement VLA systems for robotic applications
